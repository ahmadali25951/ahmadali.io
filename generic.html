									<h1>Ahmad's Portfolio as<br />
									Freelance System Administrator</h1>
									<p>Here are a few examples of the type of work Ahmad has done as a freelance systems administrator</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>SPAM CONTROL</h2>
									<P>A small company that has been running proprietary online community software since 1993 had a major 
									spam problem, receiving around a quarter of a million spam messages a day. The company did not have 
									the means to purchase dedicated spam-filtering hardware that could handle this much spam, nor could 
									they outsource their email because of the large number of email users. Ahmad configured multiple open 
									source anti-spam packages to work together to make the load manageable by a single server at a small 
									fraction of the proposed $10,000 hardware solution cost, with very minimal maintenance costs.</p>
									<h2>DISASTER RECOVERY</h2>
									<p>The main order-processing server of an online retailer died one evening because of a failed hard drive, 
									just days before a promotional mailing was due to go out. Ahmad built and reconfigured the server from 
									data-only backups onto a temporary server and had the site back up in less than three hours, allowing 
									the company time to properly plan a replacement server.</p>
									<h2>SOLARIS WEB SERVER RECOVERY</h2>
									<p>A client who relies on ad revenue from websites for his income had a Solaris server with a very complex 
									setup. The server crashed, and the client couldn’t get it back up and was rapidly losing revenue. Ahmad 
									worked 13 hours straight to get the server running again</p>
									<h2>LONG-TERM PLANNING</h2>
									<p>A client offering diverse online services had several aging servers and maintenance costs were becoming 
									a major burden. They were worried about upfront cost of replacing them but the effort and expense of 
									consolidating all the different services onto a single server was also prohibitive. I implemented a virtual 
									hosting platform that provided each distinct server its own virtual hardware, allowing for minimal 
									migration costs and a hardware cost that was roughly 50% of the proposed upgrade costs for all the 
									servers, while providing better overall hardware to the individual servers.</p>
								<h2>SPECIALIZED DATA PROCESSING</h2>
								<p>A client needed an online method for users to enter data remotely and gather statistics from the data. 
									There were no usable out of the box solutions that were configurable to meet the required 
									specifications. Ahmad quickly built a secure website in PHP with a MySQL backend that did error 
									checking, allowing individual data enterers to input their data correctly. He also wrote a script, which 
									nightly compiles the necessary statistics. The client was relieved to avoid the hassle of finding a 
									dedicated programmer.</p>
									<h2>SERVER MIGRATION</h2>
									<p>Even with the best planning and foresight, eventually all servers come to the end of their usable life 
										cycle. Ahmad perfected a method for server migration, which eliminates data loss, allows for testing, 
										and limits downtime to just a few minutes.</p>
										<h2>COMPLEX SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE PLANNING</h2>
										<p>A client wanted to provide a complex Software as a Service to a large number of customers. Ahmad 
											researched the back-end software and hardware requirements of the software, determined that a Citrix 
											environment would be optimal. This added additional requirements, but he was able to provide a 
											detailed proposal, which spelled out the interoperation, redundancy, and security of eight separate 
											servers, as well as a physical colocation facility and internet connection. When broken down over three 
											years, mine proposal was less than 80% of the cost of a managed solution.</p>
											<h2>SERVER AND INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING</h2>
											<p>In a shared office environment, the network, internet connection, and servers, were being overloaded, 
												frustrating all of the users. The owners of the office space needed to determine the cause of the 
												problem and be able to monitor their hardware’s usage to forestall any further problems. Ahmad used 
												the open source monitoring softwares MRTG & RRDtool to map out the hardware assets and quickly 
												find and resolve the problem. The owners were able to continue to use the software to monitor their 
												hardware to ensure that any future problems were caught before they were detrimental.</p>
